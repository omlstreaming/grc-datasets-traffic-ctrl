*Traffic Prediction Datasets*
- Datasets from a variety of traffic sensors (i.e. induction loops) for traffic prediction. The data is useful for forecasting traffic patterns and adjusting stop-light control parameters, i.e. cycle length, offset and split times.
- The dataset contains recorded data from 6 crosses in the urban area for the last 56 days, in the form of flow timeseries, depicted the number of vehicles passing every 5 minutes for a whole day (i.e. 12 readings/h, 288 readings/day, 16128 readings / 56 days).

Some example data depicting the number of cars in the 6 crosses in 40 minutes (each line is sampled every 5 min).
